The main objective of this work was the implementation of a secure username/password based user identification scheme in structured P2P
networks using secure routing and building of trust between nodes. As other P2P
systems, a 100\% secure implementation cannot be achieved
(section~\ref{sec:pseudo-secure}). Still, as seen in the
protocols evaluation (section~\ref{sec:evaluation}), an acceptable probability of error of the order
of $10^{-14}$ can be achieved with a leafset size of $L = 32$. Also the system
maintains a cost scalable when the size of nodes $N$ of the DHT increases.
This was possible thanks to the use of a reputation system and trusted
nodes management, which mitigated the effectivity of malicious nodes attacks in
the network.

An over DHT implementation allows let the system be easily adaptable  to the
most commonly used P2P networks.
While the system does not allow password recovery operations...
