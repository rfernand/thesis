% Another issue that was not addressed is the bootstrapping of the P2P system.
% When the P2P system starts building up, there are no real trusted
% nodes and the services rely on just the few nodes that comprise the
% system. During that time there is a higher probability of failure of the protocols, and the system is
% more vulnerable to byzantine node attacks. Further research is still needed on
% that matter.

% Also, more research will be needed on new functionalities and addressing the
% problem of forgotten passwords and offline guessing attacks.

% While our system uses a username-password scheme for the user identification,
%we know that passwords presents serious security problems as the average user tends
%to use simple keywords and/or the same password in more than one service.
%A definitive solution to this problem has not
%been found yet. While a strict password creation policy can mitigate this
%problem, at the same time, it can also increase cases of forgotten passwords.
%Our proposed system does not implement password recovery mechanisms to reduce the 
%risks to the security of the system~\ref{sec:risks_password_recovery}.

%We also mention the use of
%additional challenges during user registration, like
%CAPTCHA to further increase resilience against Sybil attacks.\\
