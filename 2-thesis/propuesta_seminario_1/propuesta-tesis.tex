P2P services are robust, scalable and self-organized by nature, but have a
complete different architecture with new problems and unique requirements.
 Traditionally, P2P networks used to identify the different nodes that compose the
system, but not the user behind each one of them as a different being.
Today, the people use multiple devices to join the network. This change of
behavior makes the per node identification obsolete when trying to identify the
unique user behind them.
Also, today the users are accustom to a username and password identification scheme.
While an early approach of username/password identification system exists, it does not contemplate the existence
of malicious nodes, lacking the capability to be secure when working in real P2P networks.

 We thoroughly investigate the requirements and features of a secure
identification scheme, along with the challenges facing a P2P implementation.

The main goal of this work is to
develop a secure user identification system based on username/password keywords in
structured P2P systems, using reputation systems and trusted nodes management
to defend from malicious nodes and implement secure protocols for the system.

Theoretic analysis of the system will be done to ensure that the protocols are
secure and do not present security risks in real environments.

The architecture to develop the system will be based on Distributed Hash
Tables (DHT) structured P2P networks.\\

\section{General formulation of the problem and thesis proposal}

\subsection{Context and Motivation}

A Peer-to-Peer network (from now onward called \textit{P2P}) is a distributed system of big scale. His participants
are called \textit{nodes} and they directly share resources and data, acting
like clients and servers. They are called big scale because they are made to
contain millions of nodes through the Internet. P2P systems are scalable,
decentralized, robust and self-organized.

P2P systems are characterized by do not having a central coordination. Each
peer is independent and has a local view of the system. The global behavior
emerges from the local interaction of its members~\cite{Aberer:2001:PIS:503271.503268}.
P2P networks natural properties make non-profitable services capable of running
with the help of the same users that use it. 

The most basic P2P systems only provide the structure to anyone in the network
to store and retrieve data in it. To provide more complex functionalities,
additional logic has to be implemented to them.
As P2P systems grow in functionalities, the need to identify users inside the
network arose.

The subject of securely establishing stable identities in P2P
systems has been previously studied, for instance by Aberer,
Datta and Hauswirth~\cite{1318567}. The need for identities mainly arose
from technical concerns, such as handling dynamic IP address
assignment, or avoiding Sybil attacks~\cite{the_sybil_attack}. Authentication of a
node is done via a signature key, automatically generated and
stored on the node. Traditionally, P2P networks identified the different nodes that compose the
system, but not the user behind each one of them as a different being.

The increase of number of devices the people have and use to join the network
today makes the per node identification obsolete when trying to identify the
unique user behind them. An example of when this would be needed, is the
backups systems. They need to store important data in the network and then
restore it on a different system from where it was backed up.

%example
To store the data safely all approaches build on encrypting backed up content.
The schemes to identify the user are basically two: the ones that
use keys randomly derived~\cite{Lillibridge:2003:CIB:1247340.1247343} and the schemes that derive
keys from a user defined password~\cite{Cox:2002:PMB:844128.844155}. While
approaches that derive randomly the keys does not have the risk of someone
guessing the user keys, they require that the user manually back up the
keys. 
% TODO: check this system
P2P storage systems that implements the use of keyword strings to derive a
public-private key pair whose private key is used to sign data and the hash of
the public key to identify the data in the storage. Both of
these systems use a keyword string as a seed to a pseudo-
random number generator that produces the key pair ~\cite{clarke2010private},~\cite{Bennett03anencoding}.
Knowing only the memorable keyword string the user can
store and retrieve information.

%TODO: check vu et al. 11 and Frykholm and Juels AND CHANGE THIS
While the identification system can function without the need of forgotten
passwords functionalities, they can also be implemented in the system.
Related to that, recovery of information in a P2P scenario has been studied by Vu et al.~\cite{5380695} who proposed
a combination of threshold-based secret sharing with delegate
selection and encrypting shares with passwords.
Frykholm and Juels~\cite{Frykholm:2001:EPR:501983.501985} proposed a password-recovery
mechanism based on security questions very similar to our
protocol for the same task. They offer better, information-
theoretic security properties, something not applicable to our
scenario. We treat the subject of password change, which is not applicable to
their scenario, although their proposal could be extended to support password
change using our techniques.
% passwords in p2p networks
At last, an initial proposal for passwords in P2P networks has been presented,
designed to handle remembered logins, and recovering lost passwords
in an idealized network~\cite{kreitz2012passwords}, and has not been proved to
work in a real environment.

\subsection{Problem statement}

Most of existing systems for the user identification in P2P networks only consider the
use of pre-shared keys to identify the user in the network. While that can
be easily implemented, does not provide to the users the flexibility that a
username-password based identification provides when using different devices to
log in in the system. As the user needs to transfer manually his keys from one
device to another, there are many security issues when they are handled without
care or the devices (like a cellphone) are lost. 

The use of a username and a password means that the user keys needs to be secured inside the identification system.
To handle the user keys without compromising the users identity, additional
security layers needs to be placed inside the P2P network.

While a solution based in username and password has been proposed
before~\cite{kreitz2012passwords}, it does not take in consideration the
presence of malicious nodes. A malicious or bizantine node is any node that does
not behave as expected by the protocol of the system. The presence of this type
of nodes can easily break the security and functionalities of the whole system.


\subsection{Thesis proposal}

Before developing an P2P system with the desired functionalities, an adequate
system architecture is needed. We will thoroughly evaluate a new user
identification system that can work in the presence of bizantine nodes, with
the hopes to reach the desirable functionalities with a minimum probability of
failure, to ensure the security of the system in real life scenarios.

\subsubsection{System architecture}

For the design of the system's algorithms our work will be based on structured
networks based on Distributed Hash Tables (DHT), which provide efficient key
lookups, high data availability and persistence.

To mitigate the problem of malicious nodes, we can use reputation systems to
build trust among the nodes. The key
idea of a reputation system is to predict the future behaviour
of nodes based on feedback about their past
transactions~\cite{Resnick:2000:RS:355112.355122}. A
transaction is application dependent, for example forwarding a
message in the network, buying an item in e-commerce services,
share or store files, etc. After a transaction, the client node emits
a recommendation that evaluates the behaviour of the other peer.
The aggregation of these recommendations leads to a reputation
value.
A reputation system built on top of a DHT has the ability
to compute a global reputation value for every node. Indeed
all the recommendations about a single node can be handled
consistently at a common location: either by a specific node
or by a set of nodes.

% Among existing reputation systems for
%DHTs, we can cite: PeerTrust~\cite{peertrust}, WTR~\cite{wtr},
%Eigentrust~\cite{eigentrust}, PowerTrust~\cite{powertrust}.
To build a group of trusted nodes, the CORPS~\cite{rosas2011corps} algorithm
presents an efficient solution to to build a scalable
trusted ring within a DHT that allows to find reputable
peers.


To secure the stored keys, the proposed system uses encryption, indirection and
rings of trust inside the network. The system goal is to offer a secure mean to
identify an user using only his username/password knowledge taking in
consideration the presence of bizantine nodes.

\subsubsection{Protocols}
For the user identification system, the following protocols will be used as a
base for his development, as further security mechanisms will be needed to be
added to secure each one from malicious nodes.

\paragraph{Account registration}

To register a new user account, the user first
has to choose a \textit{username} and a \textit{password}.

Considering a key-based authentication, the user creates a \textit{key store file}, containing all the
keys used by the P2P application the user wants to log in to.
The user generates a cryptographic key to authenticate the write operations
that will be made in the file, and store this key along with the others in the
\textit{key store file}.


% encryption and store of the key store file
The user then creates a \textit{symmetric key $K_{KS}$} ,
encrypts the file content with this key and puts the ciphertext
into the storage, obtaining a \textit{file name $f_{KS}$} . Now, the user
creates a \textit{login information file} by creating a random
byte string \textit{salt}, deriving a \textit{symmetric key $K_{LI}$} from the user
\textit{password} and the \textit{salt}.
Using the new \textit{ symmetric key $K_{LI}$}, the user encrypts the
\textit{file name $f_{KS}$},
the \textit{symmetric key $K_{KS}$} and the \textit{cryptographic key to
authenticate the write operations $K_W$}.
 The salt and the three encrypted values are put
into the storage, obtaining a file name $f_{LI}$ . The salt is stored
in plaintext, so that the user later can derive the decryption
key $K_{LI}$ by only providing the password. Finally, the user
performs the write-once operation put on the DHT with
username as key and $f_{LI}$ as value.

%unique username
If the username was taken,
the user is prompted for a new username.

%finish
Once all operations
have succeeded, the user is registered in the system.



\paragraph{Sign-in}
The user uses his username to find and retrieve his \textit{login information
file}. Then, using his \textit{password} and the \textit{salt} included in the
\textit{login information file}, obtains the \textit{file name $f_{KS}$} used to
route back to where the \textit{key store file} is stored.  Lastly, uses the
\textit{symmetric key $K_{KS}$} to decrypt the \textit{key store file} and recover
his user keys.

\paragraph{Logout}
The system does not have something like a ``session'' to maintain; the only way
to identify an user is by his keys that are obtained by the identification
process.


\paragraph{Password Change}
To change the password, the user has to rewrite his \textit{login information
file}.

Before the user can change the password, she must log in using her password to
obtain $K_{LI}$ . With this information, the password change can be accomplished:
the user is asked for a new password and a new salt is
generated. The key-derivation function is used to generate a new key
$K_{LInew}$
for the login information file. Then, the content of the key-store file is
fetched and decrypted (with the old key). A new key $K_{KSnew}$ is generated and
used for encrypting the key-store content again before it is saved to the
storage system, obtaining a new filename $f_{KSnew}$.
Finally, the login information file
is updated: $f_{KSnew}$, $K_{KSnew}$, the write credential $K_W$ as well as a new empty
device mapping devmapnew are encrypted with the new key $K_{LInew}$.
  Together with the new salt, this ciphertext is written to the distributed
storage, using the reference $f_{LI}$ and the credential $K_W$, to authenticate the
write operation. Lastly, the keys stored in the key store should be updated by
the application using our P2P protocol.

    %El uso de un sistema de reputación
    %y una gestión de nodos de confianza permitirá mitigar el efecto de los nodos

    %de usurpación de identidad".
    \item It is assumed that the use of a reputation system and trusted nodes
      management mitigates the efectivity of malicious nodes on identity
      usurpation attacks.
    %\item It is assumed that a certain amount of trust between nodes can be achieved in P2P
      %networks.
    \item It is assumed that encryption schemes available today are
      sufficient to secure the user's private data in the P2P networks.
    %\item  It is assumed that is possible to develop a secure username/password
    %  based  user identification scheme in P2P networks. 

    %\item As we require the storage system of the P2P network to support some
    %  minimalistic access control, we assumed that each stored file has an
    %  owner, which is the user who created the file, so that only the owner can
    %  perform the write operation.

    %\item To authenticate ownership of files, we assume that a public-key
    %  cryptographic system is used.

% translate and change this
P2P networks presents a big difficulty to be tested in a real environment
because of the high number of nodes needed to try it out.
Therefore, instead of going after an empiric validation of the proposed
identification system, only a  theoretical evaluation will be presented.
The proposed system will be compared with the other systems available at
the moment with a thoroughly analysis of the security of the algorithm used.

Taking that in consideration, the theoretical evaluation will be focused in:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Proving that the system will have a minimal probability of error,
      taking in consideration that there are two different types: false positives and
      false negatives. The first is when the system identifies an user as ``foo''
      and he is not, and the last is when the system says that the user is not
      ``bar'' when he really is it.
    \item Proving that the system will  maintain his consistency in networks with at most 30\% of bizantine nodes.
