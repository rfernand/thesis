Outlier detection
    - find objects that are different from most other objects
    - how to measure such dissimilarity/exceptionality/inconsistency?
    - how to explore the data set to find outliers?
    - Anomaly does not implies necessarily a small number
    - An anomaly can also be caused by errors in the code.

    Applications:
        - Fraud detection
        - Network intrusion detection
        - Ecosystem disturbances
        - Medical diagnosis
        - Public health

    Definition
    - An outlier is an observation that differs so much from other observations
      as to arouse suspicion that it was generated by a different mechanism.

    Natural variation
        When data can be modeled by a normal distribution, most objects are
near a center, extreme values have low likelihood, nevertheless they can be
interesting.

    Data measurement and Collection erros
        Incorrect recordings need to be cleaned of all the noise in there.

    Model-based techniques
        - build a model of the data: outliers will fit poorly in the model.
            - if hte model is a set of clusters, the outlier will not fit well
              to any cluster, and if the model is a regression then the outlier
              will be far from the predicted value.
              ..
    Proximity-based techniques:
        - Anomalous objects are those that are distant from most of the other
          objects. In two or three dimension, scatter plots allow visual
          identification of anomalies.
    Density-based techniques:
        - Similar to the proximity-bsaed techniuques.
    Supervised:
        - There exists a training set with both anomalous and normal objects
    Unsupervised:
        - Labels are not avilable
    Semi-supervised:
        - The training set contains only normal objects


    Things to considerate
        - Number of attributes used
        - Global versus Local Perspective
        - Degree of Anomaly
        - How that operate: Discover one or many anomalies at once?
        - Evaluation: Usual measures for the evaluation of classifiers are
          uneffective due to the ubbalancing of normal and anomaly class.
        - Efficiency
        

        

Outlier detection in parallel and distributed environments

    Weight/Score
        - a function of the k nearest neighbors measuring the degree of
          outlierness of an object
        - a possible solution is using the node distances to its k nearest
          neighborgs.

    The problem
        It may be the case that the data are distributed over a set of
        independent nodes .
            - each node having its own storage, computing power, and such.

    Solution
        - execute a discovery algorithm in the nodes and send some partial
          results to a coordinator node, in order to produce the finals.
            - improved privacy, sinsce only partial results, no the original
              data, are sent to a coordinator.
    Bays algorithm
        - a simple nested loop with simple... 
        - initialize Ci by selecting random objects from the dataset D 
          set Active = D.
        - If Ci is emptu halt
            compute the distance function at all pairs in C_j x D
            remove from active all objects having current weight smaller tha
then n-th weight in Cj. ...

    Proposed approach
        - distributed solving set
        - Main cycle in a supervisor mode with two steps
          starts with:
            - Supervisor global initialization
            - Each node initializes a set of candidates picking objects locally
              at random.
            - minOUT records the current minimun weight of the top-n outlier
        


Problems with the proposed solution
    - needs to send the data to a coordinator node
    - can have problems cause it don't see the global scope of the data.
        - it just make pre-calculations in each node, and send only one data per
          node. That can be fast, but is it effective?
