         become a phenomenon since 3rd party developer tools
         were released by OSNs such as Facebook. However, apart
         from their explosive popularity, little is known about
         the nature of the social networks that are built during
         play. In this paper, we present the findings of a
         network analysis study carried out on two Facebook
         applications, in comparison with a similar but
         stand-alone game. We found that games built both on and
         off a social graph exhibit similar social properties.
         Specifically, the distribution of player-to-player
         interactions decays as a power law with a similar
         exponent for the majority of players. For games built
         on the social network platform however, we find that
         the networks are characterised by a sharp cut-off,
         compared with the classically scale-free nature of the
         social network for the game not built on an existing
         social graph.",

         average degree, clustering coefficient, and average
         path length to analyze a virtual friendship network. In
         addition, we calculated a lighter version of cyclic
         entropy by studying the growth of the number of triads
         (smallest cycle size in a network) in terms of the size
         of the network. The experimental results indicated that
         our virtual friendship network can be classified as a
         small-world network according to the network average
         vertex degree, average path length, and clustering
         coefficients. Furthermore, the increase in the number
         of triads as the network grows larger in an undirected
         social network is one magnitude of order higher than
         that of a directed social network.",

         (DHTs) have received considerable attention ever since
         their introduction in 2001. Unfortunately, DHT-based
         systems have shown to be notoriously difficult to
         protect against security attacks. Various reports have
         been published that discuss or classify general
         security issues, but so far a comprehensive survey
         describing the various proposed defenses has been
         lacking. In this paper, we present an overview of
         techniques reported in the literature for making
         DHT-based systems resistant to the three most important
         attacks that can be launched by malicious nodes
         participating in the DHT: (1) the Sybil attack, (2) the
         Eclipse attack, and (3) routing and storage attacks. We
         review the advantages and disadvantages of the proposed
         solutions and in doing so, confirm how difficult it is
         to secure DHT-based systems in an adversarial
         environment.",

  abstract =    "Distributed Hash Tables (DHTs) provide an efficient
         solution for data location and lookup in large-scale
         P2P systems. However, it is up to the applications to
         deal with the availability of the data they store in
         the DHT, e.g. via replication. To improve data
         availability, most DHT applications rely on data
         replication. However, efficient replication management
         is quite challenging, in particular because of
         concurrent and missed updates. In this paper, we
         propose a complete solution to data replication in
         DHTs. We propose a new service, called Continuous
         Timestamp based Replication Management (CTRM), which
         deals with the efficient storage, retrieval and
         updating of replicas in DHTs. In CTRM, the replicas are
         maintained by groups of peers which are determined
         dynamically using a hash function. To perform updates
         on replicas, we propose a new protocol that stamps the
         updates with timestamps that are generated in a
         distributed fashion using the dynamic groups.
         Timestamps are not only monotonically increasing but
         also continuous, i.e. without gap. The property of
         monotonically increasing allows applications to
         determine a total order on updates. The other property,
         i.e. continuity, enables applications to deal with
         missed updates. We evaluated the performance of our
         solution through simulation and experimentation. The
         results show its effectiveness for replication
         management in DHTs.",

  abstract =    "Peer-to-peer networks often use incentive policies to
         encourage cooperation between nodes. Such systems are
         generally susceptible to collusion by groups of users
         in order to gain unfair advantages over others. While
         techniques have been proposed to combat collusion, our
         lack of understanding of user collusion in existing
         systems makes evaluating such mechanisms difficult. In
         this paper, we report analysis and measurement results
         of user collusion in Maze, a large-scale peer-to-peer
         file sharing system with a point-based incentive
         policy. We search for the existence of colluding
         behavior by examining complete user logs of the entire
         system, and use a set of collusion detectors to
         identify several major collusion patterns. In addition,
         we evaluate how proposed reputation policies would
         perform in Maze, and identify reasons why they might
         miss their objectives. Our results are generally
         applicable to largescale peer-to-peer systems, and can
         help guide the design of more robust incentive
         schemes.",
