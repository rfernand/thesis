  abstract =    "This paper addresses the problem of churn---the
         continuous process of node arrival and departure---in
         distributed hash tables (DHTs). We argue that DHTs
         should perform lookups quickly and consistently under
         churn rates at least as high as those observed in
         deployed P2P systems such as Kazaa. We then show
         through experiments on an emulated network that current
         DHT implementations cannot handle such churn rates.
         Next, we identify and explore three factors affecting
         DHT performance under churn: reactive versus periodic
         failure recovery, message timeout calculation, and
         proximity neighbor selection. We work in the context of
         a mature DHT implementation called Bamboo, using the
         ModelNet network emulator, which models in-network
         queuing, cross-traffic, and packet loss. These factors
         are typically missing in earlier simulationbased DHT
         studies, and we show that careful attention to them in
         Bamboo's design allows it to function effectively at
         churn rates at or higher than that observed in P2P
         file-sharing applications, while using lower
         maintenance bandwidth than other DHT implementations.",
